Forward Propagation in Neural Networks:

Forward propagation is the process in which an input is fed through a neural network layer by layer to obtain the final output. 
It involves the computation of weighted sums and activations at each layer, eventually leading to the prediction or output of the neural network. 
The forward pass follows a predetermined path, starting from the input layer, passing through the hidden layers (if any), and finally producing the output at the output layer.

The main steps of forward propagation are as follows:

Input Layer: The input layer receives the raw input data, which can be features of an image, audio, or any other form of data.
Hidden Layers: If the neural network has one or more hidden layers, the input data is passed through each hidden layer. In each hidden layer, the weighted sum of the inputs and biases is computed, and then an activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.
Output Layer: The processed data from the last hidden layer is passed to the output layer. The output layer's activation function depends on the type of problem being solved. For regression tasks, the output layer often uses the identity function, while for binary classification, the sigmoid activation is used, and for multi-class classification, softmax activation is commonly employed.
Prediction/Output: The final output is produced by the output layer, representing the neural network's prediction for the given input.

The output of the forward propagation is used to compute the loss or error, which is then used in the backward propagation (backpropagation) process to update the neural network's parameters during the training phase.



Backward Propagation (Backpropagation) in Neural Networks:

Backward propagation, also known as backpropagation, is the process of computing the gradients of the neural network's parameters with respect to the loss function. 
It enables the neural network to learn from the errors made during the forward propagation and adjust its weights and biases to minimize the prediction error.

The main steps of backward propagation are as follows:

Loss Calculation: The loss function, which quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual target, is calculated.
Gradient Calculation at Output Layer: The gradient of the loss function with respect to the output layer activations is computed. The choice of the loss function dictates how the gradient is calculated.
Gradient Calculation at Hidden Layers: The gradients are then propagated backward through the hidden layers. The gradients for each hidden layer are obtained by applying the chain rule to calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to the activations of the previous layer.
Weight and Bias Updates: The computed gradients are used to update the weights and biases of the neural network using an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam, etc.). The update is scaled by a learning rate, which determines the step size during the weight and bias adjustments.
Iterations: The forward and backward propagation steps are iteratively performed for multiple epochs during the training process until the neural network converges to an optimal set of weights and biases.

Backpropagation allows the neural network to learn from its mistakes and improve its predictions over time. 
It is a key algorithm in training deep learning models and has made it possible to efficiently optimize complex neural networks with multiple layers and millions of parameters.



Genetic Algorithms 

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are search and optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. 
They are a type of evolutionary algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. 
GAs work by evolving a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations, applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to create new generations of solutions that are progressively better suited to the problem at hand.
